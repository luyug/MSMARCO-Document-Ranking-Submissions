# MS MARCO Document Ranking Submissions

This repo holds the official MS MARCO document ranking leaderboard and describes the process for submitting runs.
All associated data for the task (corpus, training data, eval queries, etc.) are held in [this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking).

## Submission Instructions

To make a submission, please follow these instructions:

1. Decide on a submission id, which will be a permanent (public) unique key. The submission id should be of the form `yyyymmdd-foo`, where `foo` can be a suffix of your choice, e.g., your group's name.
Please keep the length reasonable.
See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking-Archive/tree/main/submissions) for examples.
`yyyymmdd` should correspond to the submission date of your run.

2. In the directory `submissions/`, create the following files:
   1. `submissions/yyyymmdd-foo/dev.txt.bz2` - run file on the dev queries (`msmarco-docdev-queries.tsv`), bz2-compressed
   2. `submissions/yyyymmdd-foo/eval.txt.bz2` - run file on the eval queries (`docleaderboard-queries.tsv`), bz2-compressed
   3. `submissions/yyyymmdd-foo-metadata.json`, in the following format:

       ```
        {
          "team": "team name",
          "model_description": "model description",
          "paper": "url",              // URL to paper
          "code": "url",               // URL to code
          "type": "full ranking"       // either 'full ranking' or 'reranking'
        }
       ```
       Leave the value of `paper` and `code` empty (i.e., the empty string) if not available.
       These fields correspond to what is shown on the leaderboard.

3. Run our evaluation script to make sure everything is in order (and fix any errors):
   ```bash
   $ python eval/run_eval.py --id yyyymmdd-foo
   ```

4. Package (i.e., encrypt) the submission using the following script:
   ```bash
   $ eval/pack.sh yyyymmdd-foo
   ```

5. Open a pull request against this repository.
The subject (title) of the pull request should be "Submission yyyymmdd-foo", where `yyyymmdd-foo` is the submission id you decided on.
This pull request should contain exactly three files:
   1. `submissions/yyyymmdd-foo.key.bin.enc` - the encrypted key
   2. `submissions/yyyymmdd-foo.tar.enc` - the encrypted tarball
   3. `submissions/yyyymmdd-foo-metadata.json.enc` - the encrypted metadata

## Additional Submission Guidelines
The goal of the MS MARCO leaderboard is to encourage coopetition (cooperation + competition) among various groups working on deep learning and other methods for search that requires or benefits from large scale training data.
So, while we encourage friendly competition between different participating groups for top positions on the leaderboard, our core motivation is to ensure that over time the leaderboard provides meaningful scientific insights about how different methods compare to each other and answer questions like whether we are making real progress as a research community.
All participants are requested to abide by this spirit of coopetition and strictly observe good scientific principles when participating.
We will follow an honour system and expect participants to ensure that they are acting in compliance with both the policies and the spirit of this leaderboard.
We will also periodically audit all submissions ourselves and may flag issues as appropriate. 

### Frequency of Submission
The eval set is meant to be a blind set.
We want to discourage modeling decisions based eval numbers to avoid overfitting to the set.
To ensure this, we request participants to submit:

1. No more than 2 runs in any given period of 30 days.
2. No more than 1 run with very small changes, such as different random seeds or different hyper-parameters (e.g., small changes in number of layers or number of training epochs).

Participants who may want to run ablation studies on their models are encouraged to do so on the dev set, but not on the eval set.

### Metadata Updates

The metadata you provide during run submission, is meant to be final.
However, we do allow restricted updates to the metadata JSON file, for example, if you wish to associate your submission with a paper or a code repository.
Note, however, that both team/model descriptions and the submitted runs themselves are immutable and cannot be altered once they are submitted.
We would of course try to accomodate reasonable exceptions to this rule, e.g., fixing a typo in the team name.
To update your metadata, simply send a pull request with an updated metadata JSON file, encrypted with the same key.

### Anonymous Submissions

We allow anonymous submissions.
Note that the purpose of an anonymous submission is to support blind reviewing for corresponding publications, not as a probing mechanism to see how well you do, and then only make your identity known if you do well.

Anonymous submissions should still contain accurate team and model information in the metadata JSON file, but on the leaderboard we will anonymize your entry.
By default, we allow an embargo period of anonymous submissions for up to nine months.
That is, after nine months, your identity will be revealed and the leaderboard will be updated accordingly.
Additional extensions to the embargo period based on exceptional circumstances can be discussed on a case-by-case basis; please get in touch with the organizers.

For an anonymous submission, the metadata JSON file should have an additional field:

```
"embargo_until": "yyyy/mm/dd"
```

Where the date in `yyyy/mm/dd` format cannot be more than nine months past the submission date.
For example, if the submission date is 2020/11/01, the longest possible embargo period is 2021/07/31.
Of course, you are free to specify a shorter embargo period if you wish.

Note that even with an anonymous submission, the submission id is publicly known, as well as the person performing the submission.
You might consider using a random string as the submission id, and you might consider creating a separate GitHub account for the sole purpose of submitting an anonymous run.
Neither is necessary; we only provide this information for your reference.
